## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter 3.x â€” A modern cross-platform UI toolkit that allows building native apps for Android and iOS from a single codebase. It uses the Dart language and provides a fast, expressive UI with beautiful animations.
* **Backend:** Express.js API â€” A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build RESTful APIs. It powers all backend services shared with the website, including authentication, fetching announcements, and managing transactions.
* **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database â€” A cloud-hosted NoSQL database that stores and synchronizes data in real-time across clients. This ensures the app instantly reflects updates made from the web or other clients, providing a seamless experience.

All backend interactions are handled in:

```
lib/services/api_service.dart
```

Base API URL is configured in:

```dart
const String baseUrl = "https://your-gae-url.appspot.com/api/";
```

Main API endpoints:

* `/api/pelanggan` â€“ User profiles and authentication
* `/api/announcements` â€“ ISP announcements
* `/api/transaksi` â€“ User transactions and payments

This ensures that mobile and web platforms remain fully synchronized.
